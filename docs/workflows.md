# Workflows and Examples

This page walks through the **main workflows** supported by `qiskit-qm-provider` and points you to
the concrete examples in the repository. The goal is to show how the toolbox helps you **stay in
Qiskit** while taking advantage of **QOP/QUA** for execution and real‑time control.

## 1. Running Qiskit circuits on QM hardware or simulators

### 1.1 Local hardware with `QMProvider`

Use `QMProvider` when you have a **local QOP stack** (OPX/OPX+ hardware) and a **QuAM state**
stored on disk.

Typical flow:

1. Create a `QMProvider` pointing to your QuAM state folder.
2. Optionally provide your own `QuamRoot` subclass (`quam_cls`) and `QMBackend` subclass (`backend_cls`).
3. Use the backend with standard Qiskit workflows: `backend.run()`, `QMSamplerV2`, `QMEstimatorV2`.

See:

- API docs: [Providers](providers.md) (section on `QMProvider`).
- API docs: [Backend & Utilities](backend.md).
- Examples:
  - `examples/sampler_workflow.py`
  - `examples/estimator_workflow.py`

### 1.2 QM SaaS simulator with `QmSaasProvider`

Use `QmSaasProvider` when you want to run on a **cloud simulator** managed by Quantum Machines.
You get the same backend interface, but the QOP instance runs in the cloud.

Typical flow:

1. Install the SaaS extra: `pip install qiskit-qm-provider[qm_saas]`.
2. Create `QmSaasProvider(email=..., password=..., host=...)`.
3. Load a QuAM machine with `get_machine()` or directly call `get_backend()`.
4. Use `backend.run()` or the primitives (`QMSamplerV2`, `QMEstimatorV2`) as usual.

See:

- API docs: [Providers](providers.md) (section on `QmSaasProvider`).
- Examples:
  - `examples/sampler_workflow.py` (can be adapted to SaaS by switching the provider).

### 1.3 IQCC devices with `IQCCProvider`

Use `IQCCProvider` when you want to run on **IQCC hardware** via `iqcc-cloud-client`.
IQCC backends are flux‑tunable transmon machines and are exposed as `FluxTunableTransmonBackend`
instances.

Typical flow:

1. Install the IQCC extra: `pip install qiskit-qm-provider[iqcc]`.
2. Create `IQCCProvider(api_token=...)`.
3. Optionally fetch a QuAM machine explicitly with:

   ```python
   machine = provider.get_machine(
       "arbel",
       quam_state_folder_path="/path/to/quam/state",  # or rely on QUAM_STATE_PATH
       # quam_cls=CustomIQCCQuam,  # optional: inject a specific Quam class
   )
   ```

4. Obtain a backend either from a device name or from a pre-loaded machine:

   ```python
   # From a device name (loads QuAM under the hood)
   backend = provider.get_backend(
       "arbel",
       quam_state_folder_path="/path/to/quam/state",  # optional, falls back to QUAM_STATE_PATH
       # quam_cls=CustomIQCCQuam,
   )

   # Or from an already-loaded machine
   backend = provider.get_backend(machine)
   ```

5. Use Qiskit Experiments or custom circuits against this backend.

See:

- API docs: [Providers](providers.md) (section on `IQCCProvider`).
- Example:
  - `examples/iqcc_t1_experiment.py` – T1 measurement using Qiskit Experiments + IQCC.

## 2. Calibrations and custom gates

### 2.1 Calibrations and pulse‑level workflows

For Qiskit 1.x environments with Pulse enabled, you can:

- Use `FluxTunableTransmonBackend` to expose qubit and coupler channels as Qiskit Pulse channels.
- Convert pulse schedules to QUA via `schedule_to_qua_macro`.
- Use `add_basic_macros` to populate QuAM with standard operations (`x`, `sx`, `cz`, `measure`, etc.).

See:

- API docs: [Backend & Utilities](backend.md) (sections on `schedule_to_qua_macro` and `add_basic_macros`).
- Example:
  - `examples/circuit_calibrations_pulse.py`.

### 2.2 Custom gates via `QMInstructionProperties`

In Qiskit 2.x (without Pulse), the recommended way to express **custom calibrated operations** is
through `QMInstructionProperties`:

1. Define a new gate at the Qiskit circuit level (e.g. a parametric two‑qubit gate).
2. Write a QUA macro that implements the calibrated behavior.
3. Attach the QUA macro and timing/error information via `QMInstructionProperties`.
4. Update the backend target with `backend.target.add_instruction(...)` and call `backend.update_target()`.

This keeps the **Qiskit Target** and the **qm_qasm compiler mapping** in sync, so both
`backend.run()` and `backend.quantum_circuit_to_qua()` understand your new gate.

See:

- API docs: [Backend & Utilities](backend.md) (section on `QMInstructionProperties`).
- Example snippet: in the main README and on the home page under “Custom calibrations”.

## 3. Primitives: Sampler and Estimator on QOP

`QMEstimatorV2` and `QMSamplerV2` implement Qiskit’s V2 primitives on top of QM backends.
They are designed to:

- re‑use QuAM‑derived Targets for transpilation,
- stream parameters in real time via `InputType` (input streams, IO, DGX_Q),
- and map shot budgets to QOP shots and QUA loops.

Typical flow:

1. Build or obtain a backend (`QMProvider`, `QmSaasProvider`, or `IQCCProvider`).
2. Create options (`QMEstimatorOptions` / `QMSamplerOptions`) choosing the appropriate `InputType`.
3. Run the primitive on circuit/observable pairs.

See:

- API docs: [Primitives](primitives.md).
- Examples:
  - `examples/sampler_workflow.py`
  - `examples/estimator_workflow.py`

## 4. Hybrid QUA/Qiskit programs (embedding circuits in QUA)

One of the key workflows is to treat Qiskit circuits as **building blocks** inside larger QUA
programs:

1. Define and transpile a `QuantumCircuit` for your backend.
2. Use `backend.quantum_circuit_to_qua(qc, param_table=...)` inside a QUA `program()` context.
3. Use `get_measurement_outcomes` to recover classical results as QUA variables and streams.
4. Combine this with QOP control flow (loops, conditionals) and streaming (input/output).

This is particularly powerful for:

- **error correction cycles** (syndrome measurement + recovery),
- **closed‑loop calibration** and optimal control,
- **DGX Quantum** or other hybrid classical‑quantum control loops.

See:

- API docs:
  - [Backend & Utilities](backend.md) (sections on `quantum_circuit_to_qua` and `get_measurement_outcomes`).
  - [Parameter Table](parameter_table.md).
- Examples:
  - Error‑correction example in the README and the dedicated
    [Error‑Correction Workflow](error_correction.md) page.

## 5. Error‑correction workflow (overview)

The error‑correction use case is where hybrid workflows really shine:

- You repeatedly:
  - prepare an encoded state,
  - run a **syndrome‑measurement circuit** (authored in Qiskit),
  - extract a classical syndrome,
  - select or compute a **recovery** circuit or set of parameters,
  - apply the recovery,
  - and stream out data for later analysis.

The usual pain points are:

- wiring all the classical data between repeated QUA loops and Python,
- avoiding a combinatorial explosion of Qiskit circuits just to represent classical branches,
- keeping parameter names and data layouts consistent between Qiskit and QUA.

The provider’s **ParameterTable** and helpers (`get_measurement_outcomes`, QUA‑side control flow)
are designed to address exactly these issues.

For a step‑by‑step explanation of this pattern, see the dedicated
[Error‑Correction Workflow](error_correction.md) page, which builds on the example in the README
and explains:

- the typical challenges in hybrid error‑correction programs, and  
- how `ParameterTable` makes the classical‑quantum boundary explicit and manageable.
